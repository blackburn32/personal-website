                <div>I joined Lucid fresh out of school on their Enterprise team. We worked on admin facing
                     functionality like user management. I worked full stack, learning as much as I could, and taking on
                     every opportunity I encountered.

                <div class="card-title">Software Engineer II</div>
                <div>I got the opportunity to take over as team lead for the Enterprise team in late 2019. The
                     experience propelled my career forward, giving me countless opportunities to lead high value
                     projects like usage data for account admins, and bulk user search tools using OpenSearch. I also
                     began managing 3 individual contributors, and was responsible for their career growth.

                <div>After getting my feet wet as a team lead, I took a chance and switched to Lucid's Data Platform
                     team to work as an individual contributor on a larger technical project called the Data Sync
                     Framework. I also took charge of generating new interview questions, leading a team of more than 40
                     engineers to deliver 10 new interview questions, and ensuring a smooth rollout of the new
                     questions.

                <div>With the successful delivery of the Data Sync Framework, data integrations began
                     getting pumped out at a high rate. I worked with many teams to help them leverage and extend the
                     data sync framework, and began exposing the framework for external developers to leverage through
                     our upcoming Extension Api.

                <div>Today I lead Lucid's Extension API team and manage 4 individual contributors. We launched the
                     Extension API platform in August 2023 enabling developers from anywhere in the world to extend
                     Lucid 's editors. Since launch our marketplace has seen a huge amount of growth, and I work
                     frequently with internal and external teams to help them create extensions for Lucid's editors. I
                     have also continued to develop our recruiting processes, once again leading a group to develop new
                     interview questions, training new interviewers for our hiring panel, and mentoring new hires.

                        My largest technical accomplishment to date is the design and implementation of a framework for
                        syncing external data with Lucid documents. The framework is now used by many of Lucid's
                        integrations, including Jira, Asana, and Trello, to keep data up to date when it's changed
                        either in Lucid or in the data source. My design centers around a semi-serverless paradigm which
                        decouples the integrations from one another, allowing each to be scaled independently.
                        Externally developed extensions can also leverage the framework by building data connectors,
                        allowing for a rich ecosystem of third-party developed data integrations.

                        As team lead for the Enterprise team, I was responsible for developing a system where account
                        admins could delegate management of smaller groups of users to less powerful "Group Admins."
                        Furthermore, each group could be allocated a certain number of licenses which the group admins
                        could assign and manage. I worked with product managers, customers, and other stakeholders to
                        design the system, then led the implementation with a team of engineers. The system was a huge
                        success, and is now used by many of Lucid's largest customers.
