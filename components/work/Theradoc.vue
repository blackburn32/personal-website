                My first tech job was as a data integration engineer for TheraDoc. I was responsible for maintaining and
                improving the data integration pipeline that processed data from hospitals and health systems across the
                country. I worked mostly in PLSQL, and harrowed myself against the headaches of consulting with on-prem
                hospital systems.
